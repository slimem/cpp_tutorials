# CPP Async

## Async with sychronized destructrors
Let's consider the following example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <future>

int main() {
  std::string x = "x";

  std::async(std::launch::async, [&x]() {
    x = "y";
  });
  std::async(std::launch::async, [&x]() {
    x = "z";
  });

  std::cout << x;
}
```
This program outputs ```z``` because The **destructor of a future returned from async is required to block until the async 
task has finished** (see elaboration below). Since we don't assign the futures that are returned from ```async()``` to anything, they are destroyed 
at the end of the full expression (at the end of the line in this case). [[class.temporary](https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4659/class.temporary#4)] in the standard:
> Temporary objects are destroyed as the last step in evaluating the full-expression that (lexically) contains the point where they were created.

This means that the first ```async()``` call is guaranteed to finish execution before ```async()``` is called for second time,
so, while the assignments themselves may happen in different threads, **they are synchronized**.

More on synchronization:
According to [[futures.async](https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4659/futures.async#5)] in the standard:
> Synchronization: Regardless of the policy argument,
> [...]
> If the implementation chooses the launch::async policy,
> â€” the associated thread completion synchronizes with the return from the first function that successfully detects the ready status of the shared 
> state or with the return from the last function that releases the shared state, whichever happens first.

In this case, the destructor of ```std::future<>``` returned by the ```async()``` call is **the last function that releases the shared state**, therefore it synchronizes with (waits for) the thread completion.
